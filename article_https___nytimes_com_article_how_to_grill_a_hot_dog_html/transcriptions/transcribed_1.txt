<p>Freeze a hot dog until it’s solid. That’s the first step to cooking one, according to <a href="link">a video</a> published last month and now viewed tens of millions of times. The icy cold hot dog is then shaved with a vegetable peeler and air-fried into bouncy curls.</p>

<p>In other videos, hot dogs have undergone more extreme treatments: <a href="link">sliced into ringlets</a> and pine cones or <a href="link">slashed with cross hatches</a> and <a href="link">fish scales</a>. Though these preparations promise browned bits and quicker cook times, not all glow-ups are worth the effort.</p>
